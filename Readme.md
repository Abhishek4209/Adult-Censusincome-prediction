# Adult Census Income Prediction 
![alt text](image.png)

## Problem Statement:-
The Goal is to predict whether a person has an income of more than 50K a year or not. 
This is basically a binary classification problem where a person is classified into the 
>50K group or <=50K group. 


## Approach:-

The classical machine learning tasks like Data Exploration, Data Cleaning, 
Feature Engineering, Model Building and Model Testing. Try out different machine 
learning algorithms that’s best fit for the above case.



## DataSets:-

```bash

* https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/overload10/adult-census-dataset
```


## Run the prediction script:
#### Copy code
python application.py
#### Input the characteristics of the diamond when prompted, such as 'age','workclass', 'fnlwgt', 'education', 'marital-status','occupation','relationship', 'race', 'sex', 'capital-gain','capital-loss', 'hours-per-week', 'country'.


#### The predicted income of the Adult census  will be displayed.


## Future Improvements:

Experiment with different machine learning algorithms to improve prediction accuracy.
Perform feature engineering to extract more relevant information from the dataset.
Collect additional data to further train and validate the model.
